Welcome to BYU's ECEN 330: Introduction to Embedded System Programming.  In this class you will learn to write low-level software for embedded systems.  This will be done through several challenging lab exercises where you will design driver software that communicates with hardware devices, as well as several real-time applications, including games like unbeatable tic-tac-toe, simon and whack-a-mole.  Along the way you will learn the ins and outs of the C programming language.

Welcome to the BYU STEM Camp "Light the Y" activity! We're happy to have you. Once you have your Y-badge PCB board you're all set and ready to get programming. 

These online modules are designed to be used with an instructor or as a self-paced program. Feel free to take as much time as needed to complete each of the modules. If you already feel pretty comfortable with many of the topics discussed in these activities, feel free to challenge yourself and think outside the box. Happy coding!

↖️ Click on **Software Setup** from the options on the left side menu to get started.

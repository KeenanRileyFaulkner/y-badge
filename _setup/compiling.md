## Building

In order to check that your code doesn't have any mistakes that will prevent it from running, it has to be checked by a special program called a *compiler*. You can do that very easily, by clicking the check mark at the bottom of the screen or by clicking "*Build*" from the dropdown in the top right corner in VS Code. Behind the scenes, the compiler takes your human-readable code and turns it into machine-code (1's and 0's) that the computer can read and execute.

## Uploading

The PlatformIO extension in VS Code is smart; it can compile your code and, if there are no mistakes, upload the program to your board in a single step! To do so, click the right-arrow button at the bottom of the screen or choose "Upload" from the dropdown in the top right corner.

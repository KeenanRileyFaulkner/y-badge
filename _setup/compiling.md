## Building

In order to check that your code doesn't have any mistakes that will prevent it from running, it has to be checked by a special program called a compiler. You can do that very easily, by clicking the check mark at the bottom of the screen or by clicking "Build" from the dropdown in the top right corner. The compiler also takes your code and turns it into a program the computer can read and execute.

## Uploading

The PlatformIO extension in VS Code is smart; it can build your code and if there are no mistakes, it can upload the program to your board in a single step! To do so, click the arrow button at the bottom of the screen or choose "Upload" from the dropdown in the top right corner.

### Statements

Computer programs are made by writing a sequence of commands for the computer to execute.  These commands are called <u>instructions</u> or <u>statements</u>.

The computer processing chip (called a *microcontroller*) executes these instructions in sequence.  It can execute instructions VERY fast (up to 240 million per second), so even if you write several instructions in a sequence, it will execute them so fast it will appear to you that they execute instantly and all at the same time.

**Important:** See how each statement ends with a semicolon?  This is <u>required</u> to indicate the end of a statement.  DON'T FORGET TO ADD THESE OR YOUR CODE WON'T RUN!

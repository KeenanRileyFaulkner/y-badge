- Labs are due on the day specified and must be passed off by a TA during their scheduled hours. The lab is late otherwise.
  - Labs and source code lose 20% for each day that they are late. Weekend days are not counted as late days.
  - Two late-days are banked each time a lab is passed off by the listed early late. 
  - You can accumulate up to 4 late days.

## Late Bank 

Each lab will have an early date for pass-off. If you hit this early date, you will receive two credits to your late-bank. You can have up to 4 days in your late-bank. When you have late-days in the late bank, you are allowed to turn in labs late, up to the number of days currently in your late-bank.

Note:
  * The TAs will be in charge of the late bank.
  * The late bank is stored on learning suite. It will be named "Late Bank" on your grades.
  * All late days expire on the last official day of class. 
  * Learning Suite submission times will be used to determine late bank credit.  
  * If you re-submit after the early due date, your later submission will be used, and you will not receive any late bank credit.

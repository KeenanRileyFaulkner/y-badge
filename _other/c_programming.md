## Running Code
You may find it helpful to compile and run code yourself.  This can be done by:
  * Running on the board (You can modify your lab1 program, or copy your lab1 folder to another directory and use that)
  * Compiling and running in Linux (we have provided a [playground](https://github.com/byu-cpe/ecen330_student/tree/main/playground) directory where you can modify main.c, run `make` to compile, and then run using `./main`.)
  * Manually compile a file using gcc: `gcc myFile.c`, and then run the produced executable: `./a.out`

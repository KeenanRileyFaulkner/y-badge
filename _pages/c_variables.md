## Study Questions
- What are **variables**?
- What is a variable's *type* and *size*?
- What does it mean that C is **typed**?
- Does an assignment statement return a value?
- How do you use hex literals in C?
- What is the `char` datatype used for?
- Can you use the `char` datatype to store integers?
- (T/F) Floating point types can represent any fractional value.
- What is the value of `sizeof(char)`? `sizeof(int)`? `sizeof(int32_t)`?
- (T/F) A `long int` is always larger than an `int`?
- What does the `const` qualifier do?
- What does `#define` do?
- Should you end `#define` directives with a semicolon?
- What happens if you put `static` in front of:
    * A function?
    * A global variable?
    * A local variable?
- What is `extern` used for?  Does it allocate memory for variables?
- What does the `volatile` keyword indicate?

Each of you will have the opportunity to teach a portion of a class period.

### Guidelines
* Each mini-lecture should cover half of the class period. Plan for about 30 minutes for presentation, and make sure you can accommodate questions along the way. We will then have 5-10 minutes at the end for any other questions or discussions.
* You can use power-point slides, the white board, handouts, or a combination of any of these.
* Some of you may have attended conferences and seen several conference presentations. Mini-lectures are about teaching, not about conference presentation. A conference presentation simply summarizes the important parts of a paper to an expert audience. Teaching is much more than that. You need to first understand the technical material (this may require reading some background material too). Then, you need to find a way to explain the material to your colleagues. Again, focus on the problem; if your audience does not understand the problem, they won't care about the solution. Don't be afraid to teach material that is in some of the background that you might have read. It is more important that your colleagues (other students) learn something from your 30 minute lecture, than it is that you cover all the material in the paper.

### What to include

Your presentation should focus address each of these areas.  
1. What is the algorithm being accelerated, and how does it work?  (This is your background information)

2. What makes the problem suitable for HLS acceleration? Where there any modifications made to the algorithm or source code in order to make in more amenble to hardware acceleration?  Why were these modifications mode? Was a certain certain algorithm class chosen because it works well for HLS acceleration?

3. What HLS optimizations were applied?  Why?  Were they effective?  

4. (Optional) What is the bottleneck to making this algorithm faster?  Is it resource bound?  Memory bound?

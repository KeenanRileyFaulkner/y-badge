## Study Questions
- What are preprocessor directives? 
- What does the `#include` preprocessor directive do?
- When you use `#include <stdio.h>`, what do the angled brackets indicate?
- What function is the starting point for all C programs?
- What is the "console"?
- What is the name of the default executable file produced when you compile using `gcc`.  How do you change the name?

- What is a code **block**?
- How are statements ended?
- What is **scope**?  What is **global** scope? What is **local** scope?
- When inside a new scope, can you declare a variable of the same name as a parent scope?
- Can you have executable code outside of a function?
- What is the "C Standard Library"?

- What are the two kinds of comments in C?
<!-- - Instead of manually formatting your code, you should always use an autoformatter.  The most popular C formatter is `clang-format`.  When writing your lab code, you shouldn't need to call this program directly, rather if you have things configured correctly, it should automatically run every time you save your code.  **Make sure you have this set up and working**. -->
